Helpful Minecraft Commands
==========================

Server Setup
------------

Server commands can be entered in the terminal or in the game.
Game commands are sent with ``/`` in-game.

You'll need to run ``/op <your minecraft username>`` before running
these commands.

* ``/toggledownfall`` — toggles weather on or off.
* ``/gamerule doDaylightCycle false`` — pauses day/night cycle
* ``/time set 1000`` — changes to daylight

Client Setup
------------

To prevent automatic pausing when switching windows in minecraft,
go to your minecraft settings file ``~/.minecraft/options.txt`` and
change ``pauseOnLostFocus:true`` to ``pauseOnLostFocus:false``.
